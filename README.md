## Read this (Below)

__I'm moved to Google Chromecast Audio and Spotify Connect, and with the latest support for podcast-things and other stuff, i don't think that i'll come back to Volumio. You are very welcome to do whatever you want with the project. It's hardly inspired by a few persons (when it comes to codes-blocks), and stripped down to my wishes. The orignally target was a good and flexible way to add own Podcast-feeds to Volumio, and i for sure took the first steps to make it a succes - but i simply leagged focus after moving to a new apartmen, there i implemented Google Chromecast Audio and Home Assistant.__

__Happy coding, if you are going to use this. Please don't blame me for any errors :-) I did like to look into the Volumio Plugin-API and the way to communicate with regular Shell-things.__

__Thanks.__
